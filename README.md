My name is Mohit Chouksey.

Currently working as an Intern (Machine Learning) on a project named - "drug activity prediction" where the main objective is to develop predictive models that can determine given a particular compound whether it is active or not using classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing.

I have built regression and classification data science projects with machine learning. My key skills in data science projects include Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Training with hyper-parameter tuning, Model Evaluation.
